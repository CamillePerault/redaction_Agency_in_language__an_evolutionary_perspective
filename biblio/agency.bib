	abstract = {Culture–gene coevolutionary theory posits that cultural values have evolved, are adaptive and influence the social and physical environments under which genetic selection operates. Here, we examined the association between cultural values of individualism–collectivism and allelic frequency of the serotonin transporter functional polymorphism (5-{HTTLPR}) as well as the role this culture–gene association may play in explaining global variability in prevalence of pathogens and affective disorders. We found evidence that collectivistic cultures were significantly more likely to comprise individuals carrying the short (S) allele of the 5-{HTTLPR} across 29 nations. Results further show that historical pathogen prevalence predicts cultural variability in individualism–collectivism owing to genetic selection of the S allele. Additionally, cultural values and frequency of S allele carriers negatively predict global prevalence of anxiety and mood disorder. Finally, mediation analyses further indicate that increased frequency of S allele carriers predicted decreased anxiety and mood disorder prevalence owing to increased collectivistic cultural values. Taken together, our findings suggest culture–gene coevolution between allelic frequency of 5-{HTTLPR} and cultural values of individualism–collectivism and support the notion that cultural values buffer genetically susceptible populations from increased prevalence of affective disorders. Implications of the current findings for understanding culture–gene coevolution of human brain and behaviour as well as how this coevolutionary process may contribute to global variation in pathogen prevalence and epidemiology of affective disorders, such as anxiety and depression, are discussed.},

	abstract = {This research focused on the biographies of dating apps which are space-limited and selfwritten and therefore give insight in what users find crucial to mention about themselves and their wishes for possible partners. The content of the biographies was compared to the content of personal ads, collected and analysed between 1947 and 1985, providing insight in self-presentation in mate search through time. The method relied on biographies which were collected in The Netherlands in 2021 from three dating apps: Tinder, Bumble, and Lexa. Profiles of men and women aged 18 to 37 looking for a heterosexual partner were selected. The texts were analysed on mentions of intention, lifestyle, personality, and appearance and on usage of negation and emoji. The personal ads collection was composed and annotated by researcher Wil Zeegers, according to similar content themes. Comparisons were made between men and women, between age 18 to 27 and 28 to 37, and between dating applications. Historical analyses was done between men and women. Results include that intentions differ per dating app. Personality self-description increased over time, number of requests peaked in late personal ads. Appearance description were more frequent in personal ads, probably because dating apps allow for photographs. The most important lifestyle element in early personal ads was religion, while later ads and dating app biographies focused mostly on interests. In conclusion, this research gives insight in how description of identity and projected partner in personal ads and dating app biographies can be used as indicator for mate choice criteria and how this can give insight in societal values.},

Ofparticular interest to him havebeen intimate, sexual relationships, which he views as tending, under theweight ofglobalization, awayfrom a "traditional" modeland toward a ''posttraditional'' form in which the relationship is seen as a means to self-development and is expected to be dissolved when it no longer serves thispurpose. These posttraditional or ''pure love" relationships, Giddens argues, hold great promise for human freedom and happiness, but are so unpredictable that they also threaten to overwhelm people with anxiety and lead them to engage in compensatory addictive behaviors. This article empirically examines Giddens's claims. Data come from a nationally representative survey of Americans in midlife. Results show that people in pure love relationships reap the rewards to which Giddens points, but experience few of the negative sideeffects. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered.},

	abstract = {In recent years, romantic love has been problematized and questioned by sociologists and activists. Part of this questioning comes from relationship anarchy, a phenomenon which can be described partly as a critical school of social philosophy, partly as a comparably small-sized social movement. Sociologists such as Beck and Beck-Gernsheim argue that romantic love suffers from a conflict between closeness and autonomy. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how this closeness vs. autonomy dilemma is handled in relationships among five relationship anarchs. I use qualitative interview methods to collect data, which I then analyze within a discourse analytical framework using an adapted version of Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm theory. I argue that while relationship anarchy may appear as an expression of individualism, it is more accurately interpreted as a new paradigm in which closeness and autonomy no longer is a dilemma to be solved.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary function of love is to create a strong bond between the partners with reproduction in view. In order to achieve this goal, humans use various sexual/reproductive strategies, which have evolved due to specific reproductive benefits. The use of particular strategies depends on many factors but one of the most important is early childhood experiences, on which life history theory ({LHT}) focuses. John Lee (1973) identified 6 basic love styles: eros, ludus, storge, pragma, agape, and mania. Our goal was to check whether love styles may be treated as sexual/reproductive strategies in the context of {LHT} – slow or fast strategy. In our study (N = 177) we found that people who prefer the slow reproductive strategy are inclined to show passionate, pragmatic and friendly love, and those who prefer the fast strategy, treated love as a game. A low level of environmental stress in childhood results in preferring eros, storge and agape love styles, belonging to the slow strategy, and a high one results in preferring ludus, which belongs to the fast strategy. People representing eros, storge or pragma styles have restricted sociosexual orientation so they prefer long-term relationships, whereas those with the ludus style are people with unrestricted orientation, preferring short-term relationships. Besides, storge, agape and pragma seem to determine preferring qualities connected with parental effort in one’s partner, mania –with mating effort, and eros – with both kinds of effort. No correlation was found between the love style and the number of children.},

Reflecting on a qualitative research project conducted in different phases from 2017 to 2021, I analyse subjective experiences of dating apps in the aim of deciphering some traits of digital culture of love’s structure of feeling. I focus on the role played by the algorithm as a libidinal object invested with merit and blame, and capable of (re)producing a libidinal economy within the app itself. This is characterised by the gamified alternation of validation and humiliation, which gives the subject the possibility to deal with these feelings in the de-personalised virtual space of the app. Engaging with the app, the subject aspires to foster a careless conduct, in which moral codes traditionally associated with per­ sonhood are lifted. I argue that the policies implicit within the logic and agency of dating apps shape the techno-utopia of post-romantic love: a risk free, painless and efficient interaction, deprived of the complications of embodied romance.},

Only the latter prediction received consistent support. Both women and men held a companionate conception of love,with the exception that women assigned higher ratings to friendship love and sisterly love. Regarding personality,it was predicted that high-nurturance traits (e.g., warm-agreeable) would be associated with a companionate conception of love whereas low-nurturance traits (e.g., cold-hearted) would be associated with a passionate conception of love. Results supported predictions.It was concluded that women’s and men’s conceptions of love are more similar than has been assumed and that the two robust interpersonal dimensions of dominance and nurturance hold considerable promise for integrating the literature on personality and gender differences in love.},

This classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal relationships, and is therefore a required component for many natural language applications.
            A verb's aspectual category can be predicted by co-occurrence frequencies between the verb and certain linguistic modifiers. These frequency measures, called linguistic indicators, are chosen by linguistic insights. However, linguistic indicators used in isolation are predictively incomplete, and are therefore insufficient when used individually.
            In this article, we compare three supervised machine learning methods for combining multiple linguistic indicators for aspectual classification: decision trees, genetic programming, and logistic regression. A set of 14 indicators are combined for classification according to two aspectual distinctions. This approach improves the classification performance for both distinctions, as evaluated over unrestricted sets of verbs occurring across two corpora. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the linguistic indicators and provides a much-needed full-scale method for automatic aspectual classification. Moreover, the models resulting from learning reveal several linguistic insights that are relevant to aspectual classification. We also compare supervised learning methods with an unsupervised method for this task.},

We report on two computational models for the automatic identiﬁcation of event type in Italian. Both models use linguistically-motivated features extracted from Italian corpora. The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate the contribution of different types of linguistic indicators to identify the event type of a sentence, as well as to model various cases of context-driven event type shift. In the ﬁrst model, event type identiﬁcation has been modelled as a supervised classiﬁcation task, performed with Maximum Entropy classiﬁers. In the second model, Self-Organizing Maps have been used to deﬁne and identify event types in an unsupervised way. The interaction of various contextual factors in determining the event type expressed by a sentence makes event type identiﬁcation a highly challenging task. Computational models can help us to shed new light on the real structure of event type classes as well as to gain a better understanding of context-driven semantic shifts.},

This approach identifies the defining property of an accomplishment event as being the fact that the theme relation is a homomorphism from parts of the event to parts of the (incremental) theme. I show that there are a large number of accomplishments, both lexical and derived via resultative predication, which cannot be characterised in this way. I then show that it is more insightful to characterise accomplishments in terms of their internally complex structure: an accomplishment event consists of a non-incremental activity event and an incrementally structured '{BECOME}' event, which are related by a contextually available one-one function in such a way that the incremental structure of the latter is imposed on the activity.},

            This article investigates the collocational behavior of English modal auxiliaries such as may and might with the aim of finding corpus-based measures that distinguish between different modal expressions and that allow insights into why speakers may choose one over another in a given context. The analysis uses token-based semantic vector space modeling (Heylen et al., 2015, Monitoring polysemy. Word space models as a tool for large-scale lexical semantic analysis. Lingua, 157: 153–72; Hilpert and Correia Saavedra, 2017, Using token-based semantic vector spaces for corpus-linguistic analyses: From practical applications to tests of theoretical claims. Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory) in order to determine whether different modal auxiliaries can be distinguished in terms of their collocational profiles. The analysis further examines whether different senses of the same auxiliary exhibit divergent collocational preferences. The results indicate that near-synonymous pairs of modal expressions, such as may and might or must and have to, differ in their distributional characteristics. Also, different senses of the same modal expression, such as deontic and epistemic uses of may, can be distinguished on the basis of distributional information. We discuss these results against the background of previous empirical findings (Hilpert, 2016, Construction Grammar and its Application to English, 2nd edn. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, Flach, in press, Beyond modal idioms and modal harmony: a corpus-based analysis of gradient idiomaticity in modal-adverb collocations. English Language and Linguistics) and theoretical issues such as degrees of grammaticalization (Correia Saavedra, 2019, Measurements of Grammaticalization: Developing a Quantitative Index for the Study of Grammatical Change. {PhD} Dissertation, Université de Neuchâtel) and the avoidance of synonymy (Bolinger, 1968, Entailment and the meaning of structures.

Modality is important for many {NLP} downstream tasks such as the detection of hedging, uncertainty, speculation, and more. Previous studies that address modality detection in {NLP} often restrict modal expressions to a closed syntactic class, and the modal sense labels are vastly different across different studies, lacking an accepted standard. Furthermore, these senses are often analyzed independently of the events that they modify. This work builds on the theoretical foundations of the Georgetown Gradable Modal Expressions ({GME}) work by Rubinstein et al. (2013) to propose an event-based modality detection task where modal expressions can be words of any syntactic class and sense labels are drawn from a comprehensive taxonomy which harmonizes the modal concepts contributed by the different studies. We present experiments on the {GME} corpus aiming to detect and classify ﬁne-grained modal concepts and associate them with their modiﬁed events. We show that detecting and classifying modal expressions is not only feasible, but also improves the detection of modal events in their own right.},

The "old" and "new" modals overlap in some general functions, representing obligation, possibility, and future tense. However, within these general functions, the "old" and "new" modals have been characteristically used for different specific types of functions: the "old" modals had usages associated with hierarchical social relationships, with people controlling the actions of other people, and with absolute judgments based upon social decorum, principle, and rules about societal expectations of certain types of people. The "new" modals, on the other hand, are more personal, being used to, for example, give advice to an equal, make an emotional request, offer help, or criticize one's interlocutor. The functional similarity of the various older modal functions as opposed to that of the newer modal functions suggests that the various changes noted all represent different aspects of a single change in the fundamental semantic parameters of the language.},

            This article discusses the “democratization” of discourse in the history of the English language. An important aspect of rethinking the study of the history of English, in terms of democratization, is the relationship between the democratization of language and the wider democratization of social life and of politics. This article first considers the duality in the way language and discourse can be understood in the context of socio-cultural processes: people alter their use of language in response to social change and people influence social change through their use of language. Through a greater recognition of both sides of the language/socio-cultural change duality, historical linguists could come to a richer account of democratization. The article summarizes work that has addressed the first half of the duality: democratization understood as a discourse-pragmatic process present in the evolution of English as a response to social change and which is different from colloquialization and informalization. It then suggests areas in which study of the democratization of discourse could engage with work on the study of wider social and political democratization.},

              The distinction between abstract and concrete concepts is fundamental to cognitive linguistics and cognitive science. This distinction is commonly operationalized through concreteness ratings based on the aggregated judgments of many people. What is often overlooked in experimental studies using this operationalization is that ratings are attributed to
              words
              , not to concepts directly. In this paper we explore the relationship between the linguistic properties of English words and conceptual abstractness/concreteness. Based on hypotheses stated in the existing linguistic literature we select a set of variables (part of speech, morphological structure, countability, etymology) and verify whether they are statistically associated with concreteness ratings. We show that English nouns are rated as more concrete compared to other parts of speech, but mass nouns are rated as less concrete than count nouns. Furthermore, a more complex morphological structure is associated with abstractness, and as for etymology, French- and Latin-derived words are more abstract than words of other origin. This shows that linguistic properties of words are indeed associated with the degree of concreteness that we attribute to the underlying concepts, and we discuss the implications that these findings have for linguistic theory and for empirical investigations in the cognitive sciences.},

	abstract = {We are currently pursuing methods for “author proﬁling” in which various aspects of the author’s identity might be identiﬁed from a text, without necessarily having a corpus of documents from the same individual. A key component of such an identity proﬁle is personality; this paper addresses distinguishing high from low neuroticism and extraversion in authors of informal text. We consider four different sets of lexical features for this task: a standard function word list, conjunctive phrases, modality indicators, and appraisal adjectives and modiﬁers. {SMO}, a support vector machine learner, was used to learn linear separators for the high and low classes in each of the two tasks. We ﬁnd that appraisal use is the best predictor for neuroticism, and that function words work best for extraversion. Further, examination of the speciﬁcally most important features yields insight into how neuroticism and extraversion differentially affect language use.},

	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker’s personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality aﬀects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classiﬁcation results, we experiment with classiﬁcation, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the eﬀect of diﬀerent feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs signiﬁcantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classiﬁers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models conﬁrms previous ﬁndings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

In such situations, what do bloggers write about, and what are their motivations for blogging? Using a large blog corpus annotated with the {LIWC} text analysis program, we examine the content of blogs to provide insight into the role of personality in motivation for blogging. As predicted, we find that highly Neurotic authors use blogs to serve a cathartic or auto-therapeutic function, and reflect mainly upon themselves and negative emotions. Highly Extraverted blog authors, as expected, use blogs to document their lives at a high level, and uniquely interact directly with the reader. Additionally Extraverts use blogs to vent both positive and negative emotions. Bloggers who are high scorers on the Openness trait are more concerned with leisure activities, although they are more evaluative than intellectual, whereas high Conscientiousness bloggers tend to report daily life – and work – around them. As in other contexts, expressing positive rather than negative emotions is associated with high Agreeableness, but that trait is associated with self reference to a greater degree in blogs than elsewhere. In general, findings are consistent with other contexts indicating that bloggers tend to adapt to the possibilities of the medium, rather than try to present themselves differently.},

Our analyses shed new light on psychosocial processes yielding results that are face valid (e.g., subjects living in high elevations talk about the mountains), tie in with other research (e.g., neurotic people disproportionately use the phrase ‘sick of’ and the word ‘depressed’), suggest new hypotheses (e.g., an active life implies emotional stability), and give detailed insights (males use the possessive ‘my’ when mentioning their ‘wife’ or ‘girlfriend’ more often than females use ‘my’ with ‘husband’ or ’boyfriend’).

Significantly expanded, this new edition features six new chapters that confront, in different ways, the growing understanding of literary works as cultural practices. These six new chapters are "Popular Culture," "Diversity," "Imperialism/Nationalism," "Desire," "Ethics," and "Class," by John Fiske, Louis Menand, Seamus Deane, Judith Butler, Geoffrey Galt Harpham, and Daniel T. O'Hara, respectively. Each new essay adopts the approach that has won this book such widespread acclaim: each provides a concise history of a literary term, critically explores the issues and questions the term raises, and then puts theory into practice by showing the reading strategies the term permits.},

	abstract = {This is a book about one of the great untold stories of modern cultural life: the remarkable ascendancy of prizes in literature and the arts. Such prizes and the competitions they crown are almost as old as the arts themselves, but their number and power–and their consequences for society and culture at large–have expanded to an unprecedented degree in our day. In a wide-ranging overview of this phenomenon, James F. English documents the dramatic rise of the awards industry and its complex role within what he describes as an economy of cultural prestige. Observing that cultural prizes in their modern form originate at the turn of the twentieth century with the institutional convergence of art and competitive spectator sports, English argues that they have in recent decades undergone an important shift–a more genuine and far-reaching globalization than what has occurred in the economy of material goods. Focusing on the cultural prize in its contemporary form, his book addresses itself broadly to the economic dimensions of culture, to the rules or logic of exchange in the market for what has come to be called "cultural capital." In the wild proliferation of prizes, English finds a key to transformations in the cultural field as a whole. And in the specific workings of prizes, their elaborate mechanics of nomination and election, presentation and acceptance, sponsorship, publicity, and scandal, he uncovers evidence of the new arrangements and relationships that have refigured that field.},

Canons formed for any of these purposes necessarily yield to change over time and compete with one another at any given time. We can reasonably expect neither the abolition of selective canons nor agreement on a single one; we can, however, seek clarity about purposes.},

"Insisting instead upon "the autonomy of the aesthetic," Bloom places Shakespeare at the center of the Western Canon. Shakespeare has become the touchstone for all writers who come before and after him, whether playwrights poets or storytellers. In the creation of character, Bloom maintains, Shakespeare has no true precursor and has left no one after him untouched. Milton, Samuel Johnson, Goethe, Ibsen, Joyce, and Beckett were all indebted to him; Tolstoy and Freud rebelled against him; and Dante, Wordsworth, Austen, Dickens, Whitman, Dickinson, Proust, the modern Hispanic and Portuguese writers Borges, Neruda, and Pessoa are exquisite examples of how canonical writing is born of an originality fused with tradition."

From the evolutionary model of "Modern European Literature," through the geo-cultural insights of "Conjectures of World Literature" and "Planet Hollywood," to the quantitative findings of "Style, inc." and the abstract patterns of "Network Theory, Plot Analysis," the book follows two decades of conceptual development, organizing them around the metaphor of "distant reading," that has come to define'well beyond the wildest expectations of its author'a growing field of unorthodox literary studies},

	abstract = {The way in which authors express themselves is unique but changes over their lifetime. However, quantitative studies of this idiolectal evolution are rare. Using the Corpus for Idiolectal Research ({CIDRE}) that contains the dated works of 11 prolific 19th century French fiction writers, we propose new methods to identify, quantify and describe the grammatical- stylistic changes that take place using lexico-morphosyntactic patterns, also called motifs. To examine the strength of the chronological signal of change, we developed a method to calculate if a distance matrix of literary works contains a stronger chronological signal than expected by chance. Ten out of 11 corpora showed a higher than chance chronological signal, leading us to conclude that the evolution of the idiolect is in a mathematical sense monotonic, supporting the rectilinearity hypothesis previously put forward in the stylometric literature. The rectilinear property of the evolution of the idiolect found for most authors in {CIDRE} subsequently enabled us to propose a machine learning task: predicting the year in which a work was written. For the majority of the authors in our corpus, the accuracy and the amount of variance that is explained by the model were high and we discuss why the technique might fail for others. After applying a feature selection algorithm, we examined the most important features, i.e. the motifs that have the greatest influence on idiolectal evolution. We find that some of those features are stylistic and have been previously identified in qualitative literature studies. We report some remarkable stylistic constructions revealed by our algorithm to illustrate which kind of stylistic patterns can be extracted using our method},

Our study reports for the ﬁrst time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84\%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics of the writing style in successful literature, including ﬁndings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability.},

Although idiolects and sociolects are commonly used terms in the humanities, they have not been investigated a great deal from corpus and computational linguistic points of view. To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses. In final analyses testing the semantics within each literary text, this lack of evidence was explained by the low homogeneity within a literary text.},

	abstract = {This thesis combines methods from sociology of literature and natural language processing to answer the questions: what is the relationship between author gender and the perceived literary quality of her work? And to what extent can textual qualities be ascribed to author gender? I first assess Dutch female authors' chances of gaining literary prestige. Even though female authors publish many literary works, they still have a harder time climbing the literary ladder. Results of the 2013 National Reader Survey mirror this skewness. Respondents were asked to supply ratings of literary quality, on a list of 401 recent, bestselling Dutch-language novels in several genres (the Riddle of Literary Quality corpus). Even within genre works by female authors' are judged to be of lesser quality, and 'feminine' novels are seen as the worst; formulaic detectives score better. Female author gender is not a conscious motivation, but analysis of respondents' motivations shows that instead, the text is associated with 'femaleness' - through genre, topics or style. Such associations lead to perception of lower literary quality. I then analyze the text of the novels themselves to examine to which extent such femaleness of text exists. First, computational analysis of the Riddle corpus indicates that author gender is too easily assumed to be the cause of text differences. Moreover, additional visualizations show that gender group differences are often caused by outliers. In the final chapters, I focus on a 'feminine' topic, attention to characters' physical appearance. I show that it is not exclusive to the genre of chick-lit, nor to female authors. In fact, male literary authors write most about physical appearance, in describing female love interests. This novel approach shows that female author gender is connected to the text differently than expected. By reading differently, literary quality can be judged separate from female author gender.},

	title = {Rich statistical parsing and literary language},
	abstract = {"This thesis studies parsing and literature with the Data-Oriented Parsing framework, which assumes that chunks of previous experience can be exploited to analyze new sentences. As chunks we consider syntactic tree fragments. After presenting a method to efficiently extract such fragments from treebanks based on heuristics of re-occurrence, we employ them to develop a multi-lingual statistical parser. We show how a mildly context-sensitive grammar can be employed to produce discontinuous constituents, and compare this to an approximation that stays within the efficiently parsable context-free framework. We show that tree fragments allow the grammar to adequately capture the statistical regularities of non-local relations, without the need for the increased generative capacity of mildly context-sensitive grammar. The second part investigates what separates literary from other novels. We work with a corpus of novels and a reader survey with ratings of how literary they are perceived to be. The main goal is to find out the extent to which the literary ratings can be predicted from the texts. We first evaluate simple measures such as vocabulary richness, text compressibility, and the number of clich?? expressions. In addition we apply more sophisticated, predictive models: a topic model, bag-of-words model, and a model based on syntactic tree fragments. We find that literary ratings are predictable from textual features to a large extent. While it is not possible to infer a causal relation, this result clearly rules out the notion that these value-judgments of literary merit were arbitrary, or predominantly determined by factors beyond the text."–Samenvatting auteur.},

Controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER}) is considered the strongest protection against false positives but makes it difficult to reach the multiple testing-corrected significance threshold. Here, I introduce the harmonic mean p -value ({HMP}), which controls the {FWER} while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the {HMP} effortlessly combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human {GWAS} for neuroticism and a joint human–pathogen {GWAS} for hepatitis C viral load. The {HMP} simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the {HMP} to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate ({FDR}). The {HMP} has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.},

The authors have created a historical-biographical database based on The English Short-Title Catalogue ({ESTC}), a standard source for analytical bibliographic research, and extracted a data-driven canon which considers changes over time, subject-topics, top-works, authors, publishers, publication place, and materiality. This chapter provides both methodological and historical insights into the development of print and demonstrates the huge analytical potential of harmonized metadata catalogs. While quantitative analyses of the book trade were attempted before, they did not engage with the complex process of canon formation at such a large scale. The authors’ work highlights the formative role played by publishers in this process and the epistemological shift started at the end of the seventeenth century, when religious works were increasingly replaced by literary works. As the authors argue, this shift in the production and consumption of print allowed for a reinvention of the canon during the eighteenth century.},

We employ combined analysis of vocabulary and versification together with machine learning techniques to determine which other authors took part in the writing of the play and what were their relative contributions. Unlike most previous studies, we go beyond the attribution of particular scenes and use the rolling attribution approach to determine the probabilities of authorship of pieces of texts, without respecting the scene boundaries. Our results highly support the canonical division of the play between William Shakespeare and John Fletcher proposed by James Spedding, but also bring new evidence supporting the modifications proposed later by Thomas Merriam.},

Oscillating between statistical models and moments of close reading, the article shows how a quantitatively scaled-up approach, rather than reinforcing an image of global textual ﬂows as singular and monolithic, illuminates world literature as a system constituted by patterns of divergence in structure and of difference in sameness.},

Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the “close-reading” of individual works, the book describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

Forster I "His studies are not very deep," one character says about another in George Eliot's Middlemarch, "he is only reading a novel." Just imagine if that same critical judgement about novels and novel readers were accurate today! Not only would it be assumed that we all read novels merely to pass the time, but also with the assumption that they don't have much to teach us in the first place. We'd only be reading a novel, and that's it. The real knowledge about life and living, we'd be told, lies elsewhere, maybe in the great epics of bygone ages, intensely private lyric poems, or sweeping dramas where all the world's a stage. The novel, of course, still has its detractors, but no one can deny that this literary genre runs "very deep." Part of that depth comes from the fact that the novel, a term ironically rooted in the Latin word for new (novum), is actually rather old. In fact, by some accounts it goes back 4,000 years to the narrative fictions of ancient Egypt with examples appearing subsequently as far afield as Hellenistic Greece, the histories and romances of medieval China and France, and the subgenres of modern England, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, Japan, and the United States. And if the forms of the novel are indeed many, they are evidence enough that there has been an ongoing desire across cultures and over millenia to tell fictional stories in prose about life" ...},

But it may be time to reexamine the assumption that numbers are useful only for objective description. Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence used to train them. To dramatize perspectival uses of machine learning, I train models of genre on groups of books categorized by historical actors who range from Edwardian advertisers to contemporary librarians. Comparing the perspectives implicit in their choices casts new light on received histories of genre. Scientific romance and science fiction—whose shifting names have often suggested a fractured history—turn out to be more stable across two centuries than the genre we call fantasy. ({TU})},

Scientists and social scientists use them to think about the social or natural worlds and to represent those worlds in a simplified manner. Statistical models, which dominate the social sciences, particularly in economics, are typically equations with response and predictor variables. Specifically, a researcher seeks to understand some social phenomenon, such as the relation between students' scores on a math test and how many hours the students spent preparing for the exam. To predict or describe this relation, the researcher constructs a quantitative model with quantitative inputs (the number of hours each student spent studying) and outputs (each student's test score). The researcher hopes that the number of hours a student spent preparing for the exam will correlate with the student's score. If it does, this quantified relation can help describe the overall dynamics of test taking.},

For scholars interested in agency, it demonstrates the importance of looking closely at language and argues that the issues surrounding linguistic form and agency are relevant to anthropologists with widely divergent research agendas. Linguistic anthropologists have made significant contributions to the understanding of agency as it emerges in discourse, and the final sections of this essay describe some of the most promising research in the study of language and gender, literacy practices, and the dialogic construction of meaning and agency.},

Linguistic analyses of the most popular songs from 1980–2007 demonstrated changes in word use that mirror psychological change. Over time, use of words related to self-focus and antisocial behavior increased, whereas words related to other-focus, social interactions, and positive emotion decreased. These findings offer novel evidence regarding the need to investigate how changes in the tangible artifacts of the sociocultural environment can provide a window into understanding cultural changes in psychological processes.

	abstract = {The cultural evolution of introspective thought has been recognized to undergo a drastic change during the middle of the first millennium {BC}. This period, known as the “Axial Age,” saw the birth of religions and philosophies still alive in modern culture, as well as the transition from orality to literacy—which led to the hypothesis of a link between introspection and literacy. Here we set out to examine the evolution of introspection in the Axial Age, studying the cultural record of the Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian literary traditions. Using a statistical measure of semantic similarity, we identify a single “arrow of time” in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and a more complex non-monotonic dynamics in the Greco-Roman tradition reflecting the rise and fall of the respective societies. A comparable analysis of the twentieth century cultural record shows a steady increase in the incidence of introspective topics, punctuated by abrupt declines during and preceding the First and Second World Wars. Our results show that (a) it is possible to devise a consistent metric to quantify the history of a high-level concept such as introspection, cementing the path for a new quantitative philology and (b) to the extent that it is captured in the cultural record, the increased ability of human thought for self-reflection that the Axial Age brought about is still heavily determined by societal contingencies beyond the orality-literacy nexus.},

	abstract = {Narrative fictions have surely become the single most widespread source of entertainment in the world. In their free time, humans read novels and comics, watch movies and {TV} series, and play video games: they consume stories that they know to be false. Such behaviors are expanding at lightning speed in modern societies. Yet, the question of the origin of fictions has been an evolutionary puzzle for decades: Are fictions biological adaptations, or the by-products of cognitive mechanisms that evolved for another purpose? The absence of any consensus in cognitive science has made it difficult to explain how narrative fictions evolve culturally. We argue that current conflicting hypotheses are partly wrong, and partly right: narrative fictions are by-products of the human mind, because they obviously co-opt some pre-existing cognitive preferences and mechanisms, such as our interest for social information, and our abilities to do mindreading and to imagine counterfactuals. But humans reap some fitness benefits from producing and consuming such appealing cultural items, making fictions adaptive. To reconcile these two views, we put forward the hypothesis that narrative fictions are best seen as entertainment technologies that is, as items crafted by some people for the proximate goal to grab the attention of other people, and with the ultimate goal to fulfill other evolutionary-relevant functions that become easier once other people’s attention is caught. This hypothesis explains why fictions are filled with exaggerated and entertaining stimuli, why they fit so well the changing preferences of the audience they target, and why producers constantly make their fictions more attractive as time goes by, in a cumulative manner.},

In a set of four studies, we demonstrate that verbs—a basic linguistic category present and distinguishable in most languages—are related to the perception of agency, a fundamental dimension of social perception. In an archival analysis of actual language use in Polish and German, we found that targets stereotypically associated with high agency (men and young people) are presented in the immediate neighborhood of a verb more often than non‐agentic social targets (women and older people). Moreover, in three experiments using a pseudo‐word paradigm, verbs (but not adjectives and nouns) were consistently associated with agency (but not with communion). These results provide consistent evidence that verbs, as grammatical vehicles of action, are linguistic markers of agency. In demonstrating meta‐semantic effects of language, these studies corroborate the view of language as a social tool and an integral part of social perception.

This article reviews psychological models of self‐control and describes a new integrative approach based on construal level theory (e.g., Trope \& Liberman, 2003). This construal‐level perspective proposes that people's subjective mental construals or representations of events impacts self‐control. Specifically, more abstract, global (high‐level) construals promote self‐control success, whereas more concrete, local (low‐level) construals tend to lead to self‐control failure. That is, self‐control is promoted when people see the proverbial forest beyond the trees. This article surveys research findings that demonstrate that construing events at high‐level versus low‐level construals promotes self‐control. This article also discusses how a construal‐level perspective promotes understanding of self‐control failures. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The capacity to adapt to resource distributions by modulating the frequency of exploratory and exploitative behaviors is common across metazoans and is arguably a principal selective force in the evolution of cognition. Here we (1) review recent work investigating behavioral and biological commonalities between external foraging in space and internal foraging over environments specified by cognitive representations, and (2) explore the implications of these commonalities for understanding the origins of the self. Behavioural commonalities include the capacity for what is known as area-restricted search in the ecological literature: this is search focussed around locations where resources have been found in the past, but moving away from locations where few resources are found, and capable of producing movement patterns mimicking Lévy flights. Area-restricted search shares a neural basis across metazoans, and these biological commonalities in vertebrates suggest an evolutionary homology between external and internal foraging. Internal foraging, and in particular a form we call embodied prospective foraging, makes available additional capacities for prediction based on search through a cognitive representation of the external environment, and allows predictions about outcomes of possible future actions. We demonstrate that cognitive systems that use embodied prospective foraging require a primitive sense of self, needed to distinguish actual from simulated action. This relationship has implications for understanding the evolution of autonoetic consciousness and self-awareness.},

	abstract = {The term “agency” is quite slippery and is used differently depending on the epistemological roots and goals of scholars who employ it. Distressingly, the sociological literature on the concept rarely addresses relevant social psychological research. We take a social behaviorist approach to agency by suggesting that individual temporal orientations are underutilized in conceptualizing this core sociological concept. Different temporal foci—the actor's engaged response to situational circumstances—implicate different forms of agency. This article offers a theoretical model involving four analytical types of agency (“existential,” “identity,” “pragmatic,” and “life course”) that are often conflated across treatments of the topic. Each mode of agency overlaps with established social psychological literatures, most notably about the self, enabling scholars to anchor overly abstract treatments of agency within established research literatures.},

The personal pronouns were analyzed in terms of the number of 1st- and 2nd-person singular pronouns and whether the pronouns can be dropped when used as the subject of a sentence in speech. Cultures with pronoun drop languages tended to be less Individualistic than those with nonpronoun drop languages. The number of personal pronouns correlated with some cultural dimensions that reflected different conceptions of the person. Personal deixis (person-indexing pronouns) may provide a window through which cultural practices can be investigated. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Moreover, bilinguals expressed more intense affect when speaking the same language at the time of retrieval that they spoke at the time when the event took place. The positive/negative emotional valence of autobiographical narratives was influenced by language and age at the time of the event and by the main agent in the narrative. It is proposed that memories and self-narratives in bilinguals are mediated by the language spoken at any given time and that language functions as a vehicle for culture, with cultural differences seeping into language and influencing cognitive styles and the self.

The newly developed Agency and Communion dictionaries were aligned with {LIWC} categories related to agency and communion (Study 2), and corresponded with subjective ratings (Study 3), confirming their convergent validity. Very low or absent correspondence between proposed dictionaries and unrelated {LIWC} categories demonstrated their discriminant validity (Study 2). Finally, we applied both dictionaries to language used in advertisements. In correspondence to gender stereotypes, male-dominated jobs were advertised with more agentic than communal words, and female-dominated jobs with more communal than agentic words (Study 4). Both dictionaries represent reliable tools for quantifying agentic and communal content in natural language, and will improve and facilitate future research on agency and communion.},

We explore the roles of syntax and semantics in expressing users' sense of control –i.e. being “controlled by” or “in control of” their circumstances– in a corpus of annotated Facebook posts. We present rich insights into these linguistic aspects and find that while the language signaling control is easy to identify, it is more challenging to label it is internally or externally controlled, with lexical features outperforming syntactic features at the task. Our findings could have important implications for studying self-expression in social media.},

Study 1 describes the computational method of generating time-locked estimates of concreteness based on the Corpus of Historic American English, and makes available the computed scores for 25,000 English words over 15 decades. We also report several tests of reliability and validity, demonstrating that our historical concreteness scores have high levels of both. Study 2 uses concreteness scores to revisit findings of studies that use a static set of contemporary human concreteness norms to examine historical trends of semantic change. Specifically, we observed (contra Hills \& Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015)) that distinct word types of the English language become increasingly more concrete over time and (in line with Hills \& Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015) \& Hills, Adelman \& Noguchi, (The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 70(8), 1603–1619 2016)) that relatively concrete words tend to be used more often than abstract ones. We discuss both contrastive and corroborative claims in light of recent work on semantic evolution and argue for the use of time-locked computed estimates over static human norms when examining diachronic linguistic phenomena.},

Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point—in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.

Herself a member of Generation Me, Dr. Twenge explores why her generation is tolerant, confident, open-minded, and ambitious but also cynical, depressed, lonely, and anxious. Using findings from the largest intergenerational study ever conducted--with data from 1.3 million respondents spanning six decades--Dr. Twenge reveals how profoundly different today's young adults are--and makes controversial predictions about what the future holds for them and society as a whole. But Dr. Twenge doesn't just talk statistics--she highlights real-life people and stories and vividly brings to life the hopes and dreams, disappointments and challenges of Generation Me. With a good deal of irony, humor, and sympathy she demonstrates that today's young people have been raised to aim for the stars at a time when it is more difficult than ever to get into college, find a good job, and afford a house--even with two incomes. {GenMe}'s expectations have been raised just as the world is becoming more competitive, creating an enormous clash between expectations and reality. Dr. Twenge also presents the often-shocking truths about her generation's dramatically different sexual behavior and mores. {GenMe} has created a profound shift in the American character, changing what it means to be an individual in today's society.

People who identify action at a uniformly lower or higher level across many action domains, then, may be characterized in terms of their standing on a broad personality dimension: level of personal agency. High-level agents think about their acts in encompassing terms that incorporate the motives and larger meanings of the action, whereas low-level agents think about their acts in terms of the details or means of action. Research on the convergent, divergent, and predictive validity of this construct examined its implications for the individual's overall competence in action, for the individual's inclination toward planful vs impulsive action, and for the degree to which the individual's actions are organized by and reflected in the self-concept.

We found that in eight of nine languages (British English being the exception), first-person singular pronouns (vs. first-person plural pronouns) have become increasingly prevalent, which in turn points to a rising sense of individualism. British English showed a U-shaped curve trend in the use of first-person singular pronouns (vs. first-person plural pronouns). Although they initially decreased, British English’s first-person singular pronouns (vs. first-person plural pronouns) use was higher than most other languages throughout the whole period. Chinese displayed a fluctuating pattern wherein the use of first-person singular pronouns (vs. first-person plural pronouns) increased in recent periods. The dynamics of cultural change and culture diversity were discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Verb lexical semantic properties are only one of the factors that contribute to the determination of the event type expressed by a sentence, which is instead the result of a complex interplay between the verb meaning and its linguistic context. We report on two computational models for the automatic identification of event type in Italian. Both models use linguistically-motivated features extracted from Italian corpora. The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate the contribution of different types of linguistic indicators to identify the event type of a sentence, as well as to model various cases of context-driven event type shift. In the first model, event type identification has been modelled as a supervised classification task, performed with Maximum Entropy classifiers. In the second model, Self-Organizing Maps have been used to define and identify event types in an unsupervised way. The interaction of various contextual factors in determining the event type expressed by a sentence makes event type identification a highly challenging task. Computational models can help us to shed new light on the real structure of event type classes as well as to gain a better understanding of context-driven semantic shifts.},

We present both humans and pretrained transformers with descriptions of events, and measure their preference for telic interpretations (the event has a natural endpoint) or atelic interpretations (the event does not have a natural endpoint). To measure these preferences and determine what factors influence them, we design an English test and a novel-word test that include a variety of linguistic cues (noun phrase quantity, resultative structure, contextual information, temporal units) that bias toward certain interpretations. We find that humans' choice of telicity interpretation is reliably influenced by theoretically-motivated cues, transformer models ({BERT} and {RoBERTa}) are influenced by some (though not all) of the cues, and transformer models often rely more heavily on temporal units than humans do.},

The individual subscales showed good internal consistency. However, the item-level principal components analysis using varimax and oblique rotation and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that only the Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness traits were coherently represented in the main factors derived by the analysis. Openness and Extraversion factors did not show such stability or consistency. It is argued that as a result of these difficulties, thoughtlessly embracing the {NEO}-{FFI} as a quick and efficient instrument for measuring the 'Big Five' personality traits is perhaps premature, as the instrument requires modification and improvement before it can truly be regarded as measuring five independent personality traits.

Recent advances in cultural evolution have put forward the idea that the early modern revolutions may be the product of a long-term psychological shift, from hierarchical and dominance-based interactions to democratic and trust-based relationships. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing theater plays during the early modern period in England and France. We found an increase in cooperation-related words over time relative to dominance-related words in both countries. Furthermore, we found that the accelerated rise of cooperation-related words preceded both the English Civil War (1642) and the French Revolution (1789). Finally, we found that rising per capita gross domestic product ({GDPpc}) generally led to an increase in cooperation-related words. These results highlight the likely role of long-term psychological and economic changes in explaining the rise of early modern democracies.},

The dimension, which reflected the degree students used categorical versus dynamic language, was analyzed to track college grades over students' four years of college. Higher grades were associated with greater article and preposition use, indicating categorical language (i.e., references to complexly organized objects and concepts). Lower grades were associated with greater use of auxiliary verbs, pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, and negations, indicating more dynamic language (i.e., personal narratives).

We sampled the contents of Twitter in the United Kingdom at hourly intervals for a period of four years, revealing a strong diurnal rhythm in most of the psychometric variables, and finding that two independent factors can explain 85\% of the variance across their 24-h profiles. The first has peak expression time starting at 5am/6am, it correlates with measures of analytical thinking, with the language of drive (e.g power, and achievement), and personal concerns. It is anticorrelated with the language of negative affect and social concerns. The second factor has peak expression time starting at 3am/4am, it correlates with the language of existential concerns, and anticorrelates with expression of positive emotions. Overall, we see strong evidence that our language changes dramatically between night and day, reflecting changes in our concerns and underlying cognitive and emotional processes. These shifts occur at times associated with major changes in neural activity and hormonal levels.},

Studies 1 and 2 revealed that people provide self-serving assessments to the extent that the trait is ambiguous, that is, to the extent that it can describe a wide variety of behaviors. Study 3 more directly implicated ambiguity in these appraisals. As the number of criteria that Ss could use in their evaluations increased, Ss endorsed both positive and negative characteristics as self-descriptive to a greater degree. Study 4 demonstrated that the evidence and criteria that people use in self-evaluations is idiosyncratic. Asking Ss explicitly to list the evidence and criteria they considered before providing self-evaluations did not influence their self-appraisals. However, requiring Ss to evaluate themselves using a list generated by another individual caused them to lower their self-appraisals. Discussion centers on the normative status of these self-serving appraisals, and on potential consequences for social judgment in general.

Thismeasure adequately distinguishes differentgenres of language production using data {forDutch}, French, Italian, and English. Factoranalyses applied to data in 7 differentlanguages produce a similar factor as the mostimportant one. Both the data and thetheoretical model suggest that contextualitydecreases when unambiguous understandingbecomes more important or more difficult toachieve, when the separation in space, time orbackground between the interlocutors increases,and when the speaker is male, introvertedand/or academically educated.},

	abstract = {Two meta-analyses find that Americans have shifted toward substantially higher levels of anxiety and neuroticism during recent decades. Both college student (adult) and child samples increased almost a full standard deviation in anxiety between 1952 and 1993 (explaining about 20\% of the variance in the trait). The average American child in the 1980s reported more anxiety than child psychiatric patients in the 1950s. Correlations with social indices (e.g., divorce rates, crime rates) suggest that decreases in social connectedness and increases in environmental dangers may be responsible for the rise in anxiety. Economic factors, however, seem to play little role. Birth cohort, as a proxy for broad social trends, may be an important influence on personality development, especially during childhood.
